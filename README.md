This project aims to predict rental prices in Brazil using a dataset containing various features that influence rent costs. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to provide accurate and data-driven rent price predictions. This project could be useful for real estate agencies, property investors, and individuals looking for better insights into Brazil's rental market.
